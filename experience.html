Using <a href="https://github.com/njlauersdorf/klotsa.git">algorithms I write in Python</a>, I analyze big data to understand how properties of the individual agents contribute to the dynamic, collective behavior of the whole. Finally, I derive novel mathematical theories predicated on fundamental physics and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that explain and predict the observed collective behavior.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 1.0rem" class="about__text"> Aiming to be well-rounded, my graduate school career was a juggling act of interdisciplinary roles: researcher, teacher, mentor, advocate, leader, and the list goes on. As more and more responsibilities got thrown into my hands, it was only natural to drop a ball here and there but picking it back up was key while I adjust and improve. From both my successes and failures, I've become confident in my ability to not only face a challenge but also develop and execute a plan to overcome unforseen problems: I know how to analyze and mitigate risk, adapt plans while meeting rigid deadlines, and collaborate with others of diverse expertise to solve problems.</p> 
                            <br>
                            <p style="font-size: 1.0rem" class="about__text"> For example, we hit a roadblock in my second paper where my findings changed the hypothesis to something we were less familiar with: microphase separation. At a national conference, I shared my progress and troubles, networked, and recruited collaborators with relevant expertise, such that, by combining my expertise in non-equilibrium systems and our collaborator's expertises in equilibrium mixtures, we were able to explain the emergent behavior and publish our work in ______. </p>

                            <p style="font-size: 1.0rem" class="about__text"> Successes include enabling the design of experimental systems by deriving a theory that accurately predicts the final state of a system solely from our simulation inputs (experimentally measurable properties), mathematically proving how self-propulsion modifies the steady-state force balance that enables the cluster to form and be maintained, and mentoring new graduate and undergraduate students with multiple research projects. A grant proposal I wrote for this project was awarded the prestigious <a href="#ndseg">Department of Defense (DoD) National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship</a> to fully fund three years of my graduate career.</p>

Most students fell in love with the makerspaces because of making something cool with their hands but that love can quickly fade when stocking hundreds of boxes of 3D printer resin or waiting in boredom for a customer to enter an empty makerspace. It was common for student employees to simply do menial tasks as they were told, neither realizing their importance nor feeling pride for their contributions. I made it a priority to continuously remind my team about the project's goals, their role in its success, and its importance and impact on others. I was proud that not only did all my team members continue working with me until our project's completion, but also many continued working with me on future projects. </p>
